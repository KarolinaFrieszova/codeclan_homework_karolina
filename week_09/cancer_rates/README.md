# Cancer Rates in the Borders

## Overview of the problem

The analysis aims to help inform the planning for the supply of cancer treatment services in NHS Borders. It seeks a better understanding of the number of individuals who develop or experience cancer during a particular period at this specific Health Board area. 

## Data and modeling approach

The two datasets used for the analysis were sourced from [opendata.nhs.scot](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/).

The first dataset covers all registered cancer incidence in Scotland by the health board of residence, since 1992.
The second dataset contains geography codes and labels, which allowed us to look in the first dataset for the data relevant to the NHS Borders health board.

To gain a better understanding of the incidence of cancer. At first, we get an overview of the pattern by looking at the total number of new cancer registrations over a longer period, from 1994 to 2018. Then, we look closer at the ten year data period which more accurately reflects the information required to help planning for the provision of cancer treatment services.

## The results of data analysis

#### 1) All registered cancer incidence in NHS Borders, between 1994 and 2018.

The line graph illustrates how the total number of all cancer registrations changed over 24 years. The x-axis shows the period and the y-axis shows incidence. 

As can be seen from the graph, the incidence of cancer overall increased throughout the time. Starting with 518 incidences in 1994 and 828 incidences in 2018. The most significant increase of 130 new cancer registrations was from the year 1995 to 1996.

#### 2) Most common new cancer registrations in NHS Borders by year, from 2008 to 2018. It covers only diagnosed cancer sites with over 50 incidences per year.

The scatter plot illustrates the pattern of the most common registered incidences of cancer per specific year. The points correspond to the year which is on the x-axis and the number of incidences on the y-axis.

According to the information, the number of incidences does not fluctuate significantly from year to year but rather is mainly following a certain trend.

#### 3) Most common incidences of cancer over ten year period, 2008 to 2018

This flipped bar graph displays the most common reported incidences of cancer per diagnosed cancer type. The graph is a summary of all the cancer types which are exceeding 50 incidences per year.

The cancer site with the highest number of new registration over the ten years was 'Non-melanoma skin cancer' with 3191 registrations.
The second most commonly diagnosed cancer was 'Basal cell carcinoma of the skin' with 2113 registrations. 
Further, 'Breast', 'Colorectal', and 'Trachea, bronchus and lung' were each registered in the NHS Borders over 1000 times.

#### 4) Sum of all new cancer registrations by the diagnosed cancer site between 2008 to 2018 in NHS Borders. It covers only diagnosed cancer sites with 50 and fewer incidences per year.

The bar graph displays cancer sites with 50 and fewer registered incidences per year. The graph displays count of the incidences over the ten years per specific cancer site.

This graph highlights that a significant portion of diagnosed cancer sites has a lower number of registrations per year.

## Conclusion

Clearly, as illustrated in the first graph, the number of incidences of cancer rose in NHS Borders over the past 24 years.

According to the information in the second graph, the number of incidences does not fluctuate significantly from year to year but rather is mainly following a certain trend. This trend may be to an extend predictable, however, further analysis is required.

It is obvious from the second and the third graph that the most commonly diagnosed cancer types in the NHS Borders over ten year period, 2008 to 2018, was 'Non-melanoma skin cancer' and 'Basal cell carcinoma of the skin'. 
In addition, four more cancer sites were registered each over 1000 times: 'Breast', 'Colorectal', and 'Trachea, bronchus and lung'.

The fourth graph highlights that a significant portion of diagnosed cancer sites has a lower number of registrations per year.

According to the ten-year data, there were 51 types of diagnosed cancer incidences in NHS Borders. Seven of these were registered over 800 times and 44 of these were registered under 400 times.
